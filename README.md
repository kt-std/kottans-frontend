The Udacity "Version Control with Git course" is magnificent. So satisfied with the way of explanation and materials presentation! Learngitbranching.js.org visualization of Git's most recently used operations, especially branching, provided a much easier perception of such complicated topics. Applaud! Quite excited to see further tutorials:)

### Intentions for further usage  :computer: :

*  Application of tags attributes alongside semantic tags in the markup for gaining higher search engine ranking and as assistance for people with disabilities;
* Creation of responsive web pages' layouts with such PRO techniques as CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* Implementation of CSS animation as a lightweight solution for developing interactive pages.

### What was new? :closed_book:

* Tips for making responsive data tables;
* RWD patterns: _Column Drop, Layout Shifter, Mostly Fluid, Off Canvas_;
* Average width of the index finger is in the range 16 - 20 mm for most adults, therefore buttons and all "clickable" targets have to be not less than 45 pixels (or have enough space around them) for being finger-friendly;
* Peculiarities of working with viewport and perception of DIP.

### What did surprise me?  :hushed:

* Actually, it's not quite obvious that making the website layout in reverse order (from mobile to desktop) can save you a lot of time and nerves. [Thank u](task_responsive_web_design/helpful.gif) for recommending that course! 

### Intentions for further usage :bulb: :

* Creation of responsive websites for any kind of device with both major and minor breakpoints to fit the need of even the most exacting users and give it a perfect look.

The Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course referred to [that course](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882) on one of its stages, which provides extremely valuable information on the optimization of images.

### What was new? :blue_book:

ES6 brought happiness to my life by providing such features as:

* `const` and `let` as an appropriate way of defining variables with limited scope peculiarities that make code much stable;
* Arrow functions with their concise syntaxis allowing to omit near a half of function's syntaxis constructions in its declaration;
* Template literal strings in conjunction with interpolation (totally in love with it);
* Built-in module system capable of easily `import` and `export` any necessary code;  
* Incredibly powerful and flexible spread operator `...` 


### What did surprise me?   :clap:

* [To what extent ES6 and functional programming(FP) facilitate developers' lives](https://media.giphy.com/media/NnGGHE0muVqpO/giphy.gif) by offering the great opportunities mentioned above.

### Intentions for further usage  :running: :

*  Development of easily maintainable, stable code with high performance by using the ES6 standard and FP approaches.
