The Udacity "Version Control with Git course" is magnificent. So satisfied with the way of explanation and materials presentation! Learngitbranching.js.org visualization of Git's most recently used operations, especially branching, provided a much easier perception of such complicated topics. Applaud! Quite excited to see further tutorials:)

### What was new? :books:

* Linux commands, especially which dedicated to printing;
* HTTP methods such as TRACE, HEAD;
* HTTP headers and their usage ;
* Details about the way of how does the caching mechanism work and its validation.

### What did surprise me? :open_mouth:

* Websites typically use Basic Authentication.

### Intentions for further usage :information_desk_person: :

* Methods and status codes for developing reliable RESTful API;
* Authentication and its mechanisms (MD5, SHA) in conjunction with SSL and TLS;
* Caching for improving the experience on the web by the usage of caching headers, which 
also provide optimization of bandwidth usage and save time expenditures.

### What was new?  :green_book:

* How the collaboration with other developers happens;
* The difference between the forked repo and the source one and its syncing;
* The king of commits management aka `rebase`;
* Tools for the rapid finding of the necessary information in commits history _(previously used git log and piped it to grep)_.

### What did surprise me?  :smiley_cat:

* The power of `git rebase` and its user-friendliness provided by the interactive mode.

### Intentions for further usage :raising_hand: :

Seems like I've become invincible after that task! Just kidding:)
More practice is vitally necessary.

* Work with code published in remote repo's;
* Develop on shared repo's;
* Collaborate with people around the globe;
* Keep commits history well-tended.

### What was new?   :orange_book:

* Several semantic tags and purposes of their usage;
* Typography details such as the addition of `word-spacing` property value to the default spacing;
* Certain information about particularities of grid layouts implementation.

### What did surprise me? :ok_woman:

* Making of layouts with grids and flex boxes can be so comfy and even [that much](https://media.giphy.com/media/d1MoLyoyipfMc/giphy.gif) flexible. Now I'm 1000% sure that they earned their title!

### Intentions for further usage  :computer: :

*  Application of tags attributes alongside semantic tags in the markup for gaining higher search engine ranking and as assistance for people with disabilities;
* Creation of responsive web pages' layouts with such PRO techniques as CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* Implementation of CSS animation as a lightweight solution for developing interactive pages.
