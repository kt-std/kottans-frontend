The Udacity "Version Control with Git course" is magnificent. So satisfied with the way of explanation and materials presentation! Learngitbranching.js.org visualization of Git's most recently used operations, especially branching, provided a much easier perception of such complicated topics. Applaud! Quite excited to see further tutorials:)
