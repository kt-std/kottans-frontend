### What was new? :books:

* Linux commands, especially which dedicated to printing;
* HTTP methods such as TRACE, HEAD;
* HTTP headers and their usage ;
* Details about the way of how does the caching mechanism work and its validation.

### What did suprise me? :open_mouth:

* Websites typically use Basic Authentication.

### Intentions for further usage :information_desk_person: :

* Methods and status codes for developing reliable RESTful API;
* Authentication and its mechanisms (MD5, SHA) in conjunction with SSL and TLS;
* Caching for improving the experience on the web by the usage of caching headers, which 
also provide optimization of bandwidth usage and save time expenditures.
