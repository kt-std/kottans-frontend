The Udacity "Version Control with Git course" is magnificent. So satisfied with the way of explanation and materials presentation! Learngitbranching.js.org visualization of Git's most recently used operations, especially branching, provided a much easier perception of such complicated topics. Applaud! Quite excited to see further tutorials:)

ES6 brought happiness to my life by providing such features as:

* `const` and `let` as an appropriate way of defining variables with limited scope peculiarities that make code much stable;
* Arrow functions with their concise syntaxis allowing to omit near a half of function's syntaxis constructions in its declaration;
* Template literal strings in conjunction with interpolation (totally in love with it);
* Built-in module system capable of easily `import` and `export` any necessary code;  
* Incredibly powerful and flexible spread operator `...` 


### What did surprise me?   :clap:

* [To what extent ES6 and functional programming(FP) facilitate developers' lives](https://media.giphy.com/media/NnGGHE0muVqpO/giphy.gif) by offering the great opportunities mentioned above.

### Intentions for further usage  :running: :

*  Development of easily maintainable, stable code with high performance by using the ES6 standard and FP approaches.

#### Hints and tips

Sincerely hope that these tips will help someone to run the Wittr project much faster than I did (tested with Linux):

1. Install `nvm` to manage the different node version. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
2. **Important!** Install node **v10.17.0**.
3. If you've several versions of node installed, don't forget to switch to the correct one via `nvm use v10.17.0`.
4. To check which node version you are using try `node -v`.
5. Fix problems with node packages via installing missed one with `npm i packageName@version`. The whole list of packages versions is available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).

*If you are feeling totally oppressed, check [this one](https://docs.npmjs.com/auditing-package-dependencies-for-security-vulnerabilities#turning-off-npm-audit-on-package-installation).*

P.S. If there are no images after running the application, add [this code](https://github.com/jakearchibald/wittr/issues/82#issuecomment-735363861) to your `/server/Server.js` file.
